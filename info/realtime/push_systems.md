# Avoiding Firebase Messaging: Open-Source Alternatives and Privacy Concerns

You're absolutely right to be concerned about Firebase's monopoly on push notifications 
and the privacy implications. Here's what you should know:

## Open-Source Alternatives to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Yes, there are alternatives:
1. **UnifiedPush** - A decentralized, open-source push notification system
2. **Gotify** - Simple self-hosted push notification server
3. **NTFY** - Open-source push notifications that can work without app stores
4. **Matrix/Element** - Decentralized messaging protocol with push capabilities
5. **Mattermost** - Open-source Slack alternative with push notifications

## WhatsApp and Firebase

WhatsApp does **not** use Firebase Messaging for its core messaging service. They:
- Developed their own proprietary protocol
- Use highly optimized infrastructure to handle their massive scale (trillions of messages monthly)
- Only use FCM/GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) as a "wake-up" mechanism on Android to notify 
  the app when messages arrive, not for the actual message content

## Cost Considerations at Scale

For services like WhatsApp:
- Firebase would be prohibitively expensive at their scale (trillions of messages)
- Building custom infrastructure becomes cost-effective at massive scale
- They benefit from vertical integration with their own protocols

## Privacy Concerns with Firebase

Valid concerns include:
- Google having visibility into when your app receives notifications
- Dependency on Google services
- Potential for tracking across apps
- Limited control over delivery guarantees

Many privacy-focused apps are moving to alternative solutions or building their 
own notification systems to reduce reliance on Google's infrastructure.

### **Deep Dive: How WhatsApp & Others Handle Push Notifications Without Fully Relying on Firebase/APNs**  

Let’s break it down in detail:  

---

## **1. How WhatsApp Uses FCM/GCM Only as a "Wake-Up" Mechanism**  

### **The Problem: Android’s Background Restrictions**  
- Android (since Doze Mode & App Standby) **kills background processes aggressively** 
  (often within minutes).  
- Apps cannot **persistently run** in the background (unlike iOS, which allows 
  VoIP/silent push to keep apps alive).  
- If WhatsApp relied **only** on a background worker (like `background_worker` in Flutter),
  it would **fail** because:  
  - The OS kills long-running tasks.  
  - Users would miss messages when the app is inactive.  

### **WhatsApp’s Solution: FCM as a "Ping" System**  
1. **Message Flow:**  
   - When someone sends you a WhatsApp message, it first goes to **WhatsApp’s own servers**.  
   - WhatsApp’s server then sends a **tiny, empty FCM push notification** (just a wake-up signal).  
   - This FCM notification **does not contain the message content** (for privacy & efficiency).  
   - When your phone receives this FCM ping, it wakes up **WhatsApp**, which then 
     **fetches the actual message** directly from WhatsApp’s servers (E2E encrypted).  

2. **Why Not Rely on FCM for Message Content?**  
   - **Privacy:** Google doesn’t see your messages (only a "ping").  
   - **Cost:** Sending full messages via FCM would be **extremely expensive** 
     at WhatsApp’s scale (billions/day).  
   - **Reliability:** WhatsApp controls its own delivery logic (retries, offline storage, etc.).  

3. **What About iOS?**  
   - iOS has **similar restrictions**, but Apple’s **APNs (Apple Push Notification Service)** 
     is the **only** way to wake up an app.  
   - WhatsApp **must** use APNs, but again, **only for wake-up**, not message content.  

---

## **2. Why Background Workers (Flutter’s `background_worker`) Are Not Enough**  
- **Android kills background tasks quickly** (often within 10-30 minutes).  
- **Battery optimizations** (Doze Mode) prevent persistent execution.  
- **WorkManager/Background Fetch** is unreliable for real-time messaging.  

### **What WhatsApp (and Others) Use Instead:**  
- **Foreground Services (Android):**  
  - Some apps (like Telegram) use a **persistent notification** to keep the app alive.  
  - WhatsApp **avoids this** (to save battery) and relies on **FCM pings** instead.  
- **WebSockets (When App is Open):**  
  - If the app is in the foreground, it maintains a **direct WebSocket connection** 
    to WhatsApp’s servers.  
- **JobScheduler/AlarmManager (For Delayed Tasks):**  
  - Used for periodic syncs, but **not real-time messaging**.  

---

## **3. Can We Avoid Google (FCM) and Apple (APNs) Completely?**  
### **The Hard Truth: On iOS, No (Due to Apple’s Restrictions)**  
- **iOS forces all apps to use APNs** for background wake-up.  
- Even **alternative push services** (like UnifiedPush) **must still use APNs** on iOS.  

### **On Android, Yes (But With Trade-offs)**  
#### **Option 1: UnifiedPush + Self-Hosted Push Server**  
- **How it works:**  
  - Apps subscribe to a **self-hosted push server** (like Gotify or Matrix).  
  - When a message arrives, the server sends a push via **UnifiedPush distributors** 
    (which can be FCM-free).  
  - Apps like **Briar** (p2p messaging) use this to avoid Google.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Needs **alternative app stores** (F-Droid) or side-loading.  
  - Some Android OEMs kill background apps aggressively.  

#### **Option 2: WebSocket-Based Push (When App is Open)**  
- **Signal** (private messenger) uses **WebSockets** when the app is active.  
- **Limitation:** If the app is killed, you won’t get messages until reopened.  

#### **Option 3: Persistent Foreground Service (Like a VPN App)**  
- Some privacy apps (like **Beeper**) run a **foreground service** to stay alive.  
- **Downside:** Drains battery, shows a persistent notification.  

---

## **4. What About iOS? Can We Bypass APNs?**  
- **No.** Apple **blocks** apps that try to use alternative push systems.  
- **Workarounds (Limited):**  
  - **Silent Push Notifications:** Apps can use APNs to wake up and fetch data.  
  - **VoIP Privileges (For Call Apps):** Apps like Signal use this to stay alive longer.  
  - **Background Fetch (Unreliable):** iOS allows periodic checks, but not real-time.  

---

## **5. Cost-Effectiveness for WhatsApp (Trillions of Messages)**  
- **FCM/APNs costs per million messages** (~$0.50 - $1.00).  
- If WhatsApp sent **all messages via FCM**, it would cost **millions per month**.  
- Instead, they:  
  - Use FCM **only for wake-up pings** (saving 99%+ costs).  
  - Handle **real messages** via their own optimized servers.  

---

### **Final Answer: Can We Avoid Firebase/APNs?**  
| Platform | Can Avoid? | Best Alternatives |  
|----------|-----------|-------------------|  
| **Android** | **Yes** (UnifiedPush, WebSockets, Foreground Service) | Self-hosted push, F-Droid apps |  
| **iOS** | **No** (APNs is mandatory) | Silent push, VoIP tricks |  

**For true privacy:**  
- Use **Matrix (Element)** or **Jami** (fully P2P, no central push).  
- On Android, **UnifiedPush** works without Google.  
- On iOS, you’re **stuck with APNs**, but can minimize data leakage.

**Telegram does not show a persistent "running in the background" notification** on modern
Android versions (especially since Android 8+ introduced strict background execution limits).

Clarify how **Telegram and similar apps actually maintain real-time messaging without a persistent notification** 
(and why they don’t need one anymore).  

---

## **How Telegram & Modern Apps Handle Background Messaging (2024)**
### **1. No Persistent Notification (Unlike Old Apps)**
- **Pre-Android 8 (Oreo):** Apps could run background services freely, so some 
  (like old WhatsApp) used persistent notifications.  
- **Post-Android 8:** Google **banned** unnecessary foreground services. Apps must now:  
  - Use **FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)** for wake-ups.  
  - Or comply with **Doze Mode restrictions** (limited background execution).  

### **2. How Telegram Works Now**
1. **FCM for Wake-Ups (Like WhatsApp)**  
   - When a new message arrives, Telegram’s server sends a **silent FCM push**.  
   - This triggers Telegram to **wake up briefly**, fetch messages, and show a notification.  
   - **No persistent notification is needed** because FCM handles the wake-up.  

2. **WebSocket in Foreground (When App is Open)**  
   - If you’re actively using Telegram, it maintains a **WebSocket connection** 
     for real-time updates.  

3. **WorkManager for Periodic Sync (Rarely Used)**  
   - For edge cases (FCM fails), Telegram might use `WorkManager` to check for messages occasionally.  

### **3. Why No Persistent Notification?**
- **Google Play Policy:** Apps showing "running in background" notifications without a 
  valid reason (like music playback) get **rejected**.  
- **Battery Optimization:** Users hate unnecessary notifications, and Android kills 
  apps that abuse them.  
- **FCM is Reliable Enough:** For most apps, FCM wake-ups are sufficient.  

---

## **How Signal Uses VoIP Privileges (Without a Persistent Notification)**
Signal **does not show a persistent notification** either. Instead:  

### **On Android:**
- Uses **FCM** like Telegram/WhatsApp.  
- Only activates **VoIP (CallKit-like) mode during calls**.  

### **On iOS:**
- Uses **PushKit (VoIP pushes)** to wake up the app **without showing a notification**.  
- This allows Signal to fetch messages in the background **without user-visible alerts**.  

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Modern apps (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp) do NOT use persistent "running in background" notifications.**  
   - They rely on **FCM (Android) / APNs (iOS)** for wake-ups.  
   - Only show notifications for **actual messages/calls**.  

2. **VoIP privileges are used sparingly** (mostly for calls, not messaging).  

3. **If you’re building a messaging app in 2024:**  
   - **Use FCM/APNs** for reliable wake-ups.  
   - **Avoid foreground services** unless absolutely necessary (e.g., VPN, music apps).  
   - **On iOS, PushKit is the only way** to keep real-time messaging alive.  

---

### **Why Did Older Apps Use Persistent Notifications?**
- Before Android 8 (2017), apps abused `Service` + persistent notifications to stay alive.  
- Google **cracked down hard** on this, forcing apps to switch to FCM.  

### **Can You Still Force a Background Service in 2024?**
- **Yes, but with major tradeoffs:**  
  - Your app will **get killed frequently** (Doze Mode).  
  - Users must **disable battery optimizations** manually.  
  - Google Play **may reject your app** for policy violations.  

---

### **Final Answer**
- **No, Telegram/Signal/WhatsApp do NOT use persistent "running in background" notifications anymore.**  
- They rely on **FCM/APNs push** for wake-ups + short-lived background tasks.  
- **Avoid foreground services** unless you’re building a call/VPN/music app.
