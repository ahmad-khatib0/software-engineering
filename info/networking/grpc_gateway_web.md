## ✅ Short Answer to Start

- **`option (google.api.http)` is for grpc-gateway**, not Envoy.
- **grpc-gateway** is what translates **HTTP/JSON ⇆ gRPC**, not Envoy itself.
- Envoy **doesn't** do HTTP/JSON to gRPC out of the box — it just **proxies**.
- grpc-gateway **adds a layer**, but **it’s needed** if you want REST without rewriting handlers.
- The plugin config:

  - `js`, `ts`: generate **gRPC clients** for browser or Node.js.
  - `grpc-web`: generate a **special gRPC-over-HTTP/1.1 client** (because browser JS can't speak gRPC natively).

---

## 🔄 Let's Understand the Flow

### 💡 You want:

```txt
Browser (JSON/HTTP)
   ⇅
 Envoy
   ⇅
 grpc-gateway (translates JSON to real gRPC)
   ⇅
 gRPC Backend (handles logic)
```

### 📌 So:

- **Envoy** is a proxy. It knows how to **route HTTP and gRPC**, but it does **not**
  translate HTTP/JSON into gRPC by itself.
- **grpc-gateway** is a Go library that **generates a REST → gRPC translator** using
  `google.api.http` annotations in your `.proto`.

So your REST clients (like a browser or Postman) can send:

```http
POST /v1/register
Content-Type: application/json

{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }
```

→ grpc-gateway translates that into a gRPC `Register` call → backend handles it.

---

## 🧠 So Why grpc-gateway?

- Needed **only if you want a REST interface** (for browsers, curl, tools).
- **Not needed** if you control the client and use pure gRPC (e.g., Go, Python, Java).
- If you're using **Envoy + gRPC-Web**, grpc-gateway becomes **optional** (see below).

---

## 🔎 So What Are These Annotations?

```proto
option (google.api.http) = {
  post: "/v1/register"
  body: "*"
};
```

This is from `google.api.http`, provided by [googleapis/googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
used **by grpc-gateway** to auto-generate:

- a REST route: `POST /v1/register`
- it maps `body: "*"` to the entire request message.

These annotations tell grpc-gateway **how to handle incoming REST** and map it to gRPC.

---

## ✅ Envoy Alone CANNOT Replace grpc-gateway

Envoy **can proxy gRPC calls**, and **gRPC-Web calls**, but **it can't convert JSON to gRPC**.

If you want your **frontend to send JSON**, you **must have grpc-gateway** or similar translator.

If you want your **frontend to send real gRPC-Web**, you can skip grpc-gateway.

---

## 📦 Now Let’s Break Down the Codegen Plugins

### 1. `- name: js`

```yaml
- name: js
  out: gen/js
  opt:
    - import_style=commonjs
```

- Generates **JavaScript gRPC client** code.
- **Used in Node.js** environments.
- `commonjs` format (`require()` not `import`) — useful if you're not using modern bundlers.

📌 **Use when:**

- You're building a Node.js gRPC client (e.g., microservices).
- You want to talk to backend gRPC directly (not via grpc-gateway).

---

### 2. `- name: ts`

```yaml
- name: ts
  out: gen/ts
  opt:
    - import_style=commonjs
```

- Like `js`, but includes `.d.ts` for **TypeScript typings**.
- Same use case — for **Node.js** gRPC clients.
- `commonjs` applies here too.

📌 **Use when:**

- You want a typed gRPC client in TypeScript (Node.js).
- You are not using grpc-web.

---

### 3. `- name: grpc-web`

```yaml
- name: grpc-web
  out: gen/ts-web
  opt:
    - import_style=typescript
    - mode=grpcwebtext
```

- This is special — it generates **gRPC-Web** clients.
- Used in **browsers** (since browsers can't use raw HTTP/2 gRPC).
- Works with **Envoy configured as a gRPC-Web proxy**.

📌 **Use when:**

- You're writing a **frontend app (React/Vue/etc)** that should talk to your backend via gRPC-Web.
- You're using Envoy as a **gRPC-Web proxy**.

## 🔁 TL;DR Decision Guide

| Use Case                        | Requires grpc-gateway? | Use `grpc-web`? | Browser-friendly? |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| REST (JSON) + any frontend      | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes            |
| gRPC-Web (TS client in browser) | ❌ No (skip gateway)   | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes            |
| Node.js backend with gRPC       | ❌ No                  | ❌ No           | ❌ Server-side    |

---

## ✅ Summary

### You’re right:

- grpc-gateway is needed for REST.
- `google.api.http` annotations are for grpc-gateway only.
- Envoy proxies, but does not translate JSON → gRPC.

### If you want to **eliminate grpc-gateway**:

- Use **gRPC-Web clients** on the frontend (with Envoy support).
- But you lose REST/JSON compatibility (e.g., curl or Postman won't work).

Tradeoffs, performance, scalability, and deployment environments like **Kubernetes with Istio**.

Let’s break this down clearly and practically.

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

> **Yes, moving from grpc-gateway to gRPC-Web means the frontend now speaks gRPC (via gRPC-Web), and you eliminate the REST translation layer.**

So:

| With grpc-gateway                       | With gRPC-Web                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Browser → JSON → grpc-gateway → gRPC    | Browser → gRPC-Web → Envoy → gRPC |
| REST-to-gRPC translation in Go (extra)  | gRPC-Web is native on frontend    |
| Good for REST APIs (curl/Postman/etc.)  | Good for fully gRPC-based systems |
| Extra layer (mux, startup cost, memory) | Leaner path to backend gRPC       |

---

## ✅ So What Are You _Hypothetically_ Moving?

You asked:

> “We are moving this responsibility ... to the frontend?”

Yes:

- The `grpc-gateway` Go process is no longer needed.
- The frontend sends **gRPC-Web calls directly**.
- Envoy handles the protocol translation: `gRPC-Web (HTTP/1.1) → gRPC (HTTP/2)`.

---

## 💡 So What's gRPC-Web Again?

gRPC-Web is a **variant** of gRPC that works in **browsers** (which can’t initiate HTTP/2 streams natively for gRPC).

### Why browsers need gRPC-Web:

- Native gRPC = HTTP/2 + binary framing → not browser-friendly.
- Browsers only do:

  - HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 (with limitations),
  - No trailers, no bidirectional streams easily.

- gRPC-Web = uses **base64-encoded gRPC** over HTTP/1.1.

## 🚀 Benefits of Using gRPC-Web + Envoy

| Benefit                   | Explanation                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Faster**             | Eliminates grpc-gateway (no REST mapping logic)     |
| ✅ **Smaller**            | One fewer service to run (no mux, no HTTP handlers) |
| ✅ **End-to-end gRPC**    | Stronger typing, tooling, schema validation         |
| ✅ **Istio/Envoy-native** | Can fully leverage mTLS, RBAC, retries, tracing     |
| 🚫 **No REST**            | Tools like curl/Postman won’t work out of the box   |

---

## 🗂️ How Envoy Config Changes for gRPC-Web

Just enable the `grpc_web` filter:

```yaml
http_filters:
  - name: envoy.filters.http.grpc_web
  - name: envoy.filters.http.router
```

So your updated Envoy config:

```yaml
http_filters:
  - name: envoy.filters.http.grpc_web
  - name: envoy.filters.http.router
```

That’s it — this filter will decode incoming gRPC-Web requests and forward them as native gRPC.

---

## 📦 Simple React + gRPC-Web Example

1. **Generate frontend client**

In your `buf.gen.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: grpc-web
  out: gen/ts-web
  opt:
    - import_style=typescript
    - mode=grpcwebtext
```

Then in React:

```tsx
// src/client.ts
import { UserServiceClient } from "./gen/ts-web/user/v1/UserServiceServiceClientPb";
import { LoginRequest } from "./gen/ts-web/user/v1/user_pb";

const client = new UserServiceClient("http://localhost:8081", null, null);

export async function login(email: string, password: string) {
  const request = new LoginRequest();
  request.setEmail(email);
  request.setPassword(password);

  return await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    client.login(request, {}, (err, response) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(err);
      } else {
        resolve(response);
      }
    });
  });
}
```

✅ This talks directly to Envoy over gRPC-Web!

---

## 🏗️ Kubernetes & Istio

Your instinct is 100% right again.

- In **Kubernetes**, you **don’t need grpc-gateway** if all internal traffic is gRPC.
- **gRPC-Web** is only needed at the **edge**, for the **frontend → Envoy**.
- Inside the mesh (e.g., backend to backend), everyone can just speak real gRPC.
- Use **Istio's mTLS**, RBAC, metrics, retries, tracing to secure and manage all of that.

### Typical Layout in K8s:

```
Browser
  ⇅
gRPC-Web
  ⇅
Envoy IngressGateway
  ⇅
gRPC over HTTP/2
  ⇅
Backend Service (no grpc-gateway)
```

---

## ⚖️ Summary: Which to Choose?

| Factor             | grpc-gateway (REST)          | gRPC-Web (frontend gRPC)       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ✅ Browser support | Easy (uses fetch/axios)      | Needs generated client         |
| ✅ Performance     | ✖ Extra HTTP handler        | ✅ Lean, binary, no REST layer |
| ✅ REST tooling    | ✅ Postman, curl, etc.       | ✖ Not directly usable         |
| ✅ Security (mTLS) | ✅ Supported via Envoy/Istio | ✅ Fully compatible            |
| ✅ Scalability     | Scales well                  | ✅ Slightly better             |
| ✅ Complexity      | Higher (extra Go gateway)    | ✅ Simpler                     |

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation

- If you are **starting fresh** or want **high performance**, go with **gRPC-Web + Envoy**.
- If you **need REST clients (curl, Postman, 3rd-party tools)**, or REST is a must, keep grpc-gateway.
- For **internal services**, always prefer **native gRPC** — cleaner, faster, more strongly typed.
- Use **Envoy** only at the edge to translate gRPC-Web → gRPC.
