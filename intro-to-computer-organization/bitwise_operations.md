Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on the binary representation of integers. 
In Go, the following bitwise operators are supported:

1. **AND (`&`)**:
   - Performs a bitwise AND operation.
   - The result is `1` only if both corresponding bits are `1`; otherwise, it is `0`.

2. **OR (`|`)**:
   - Performs a bitwise OR operation.
   - The result is `1` if at least one of the corresponding bits is `1`; otherwise, it is `0`.

3. **XOR (`^`)**:
   - Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation.
   - The result is `1` if the corresponding bits are different; otherwise, it is `0`.

4. **NOT (`^`)**:
   - Performs a bitwise NOT (complement) operation.
   - Flips all the bits: `1` becomes `0`, and `0` becomes `1`.

5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**:
   - Shifts the bits of the number to the left by a specified number of positions.
   - Zeros are shifted in from the right.

6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**:
   - Shifts the bits of the number to the right by a specified number of positions.
   - For unsigned integers, zeros are shifted in from the left. For signed integers, the 
     sign bit is preserved.

### **Examples in Go**

#### **1. AND (`&`)**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 12 // 1100 in binary
    b := 10 // 1010 in binary
    result := a & b
    fmt.Printf("12 & 10 = %d\n", result) // Output: 8 (1000 in binary)
}
```
- Binary representation:
  - `12`: `1100`
  - `10`: `1010`
- Bitwise AND:
  ```
  1100
  & 1010
  ----
  1000 (8 in decimal)
  ```

---

#### **2. OR (`|`)**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 12 // 1100 in binary
    b := 10 // 1010 in binary
    result := a | b
    fmt.Printf("12 | 10 = %d\n", result) // Output: 14 (1110 in binary)
}
```
- Binary representation:
  - `12`: `1100`
  - `10`: `1010`
- Bitwise OR:
  ```
  1100
  | 1010
  ----
  1110 (14 in decimal)
  ```

---

#### **3. XOR (`^`)**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 12 // 1100 in binary
    b := 10 // 1010 in binary
    result := a ^ b
    fmt.Printf("12 ^ 10 = %d\n", result) // Output: 6 (0110 in binary)
}
```
- Binary representation:
  - `12`: `1100`
  - `10`: `1010`
- Bitwise XOR:
  ```
  1100
  ^ 1010
  ----
  0110 (6 in decimal)
  ```

---

#### **4. NOT (`^`)**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 12 // 1100 in binary
    result := ^a
    fmt.Printf("^12 = %d\n", result) // Output: -13 (in two's complement)
}
```
- Binary representation:
  - `12`: `00001100` (8 bits for simplicity)
- Bitwise NOT:
  ```
  ^00001100
  --------
  11110011 (in two's complement, this represents -13)
  ```

---

#### **5. Left Shift (`<<`)**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 3 // 0011 in binary
    result := a << 2
    fmt.Printf("3 << 2 = %d\n", result) // Output: 12 (1100 in binary)
}
```
- Binary representation:
  - `3`: `0011`
- Left shift by 2:
  ```
  0011 << 2
  ----
  1100 (12 in decimal)
  ```

---

#### **6. Right Shift (`>>`)**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 12 // 1100 in binary
    result := a >> 2
    fmt.Printf("12 >> 2 = %d\n", result) // Output: 3 (0011 in binary)
}
```
- Binary representation:
  - `12`: `1100`
- Right shift by 2:
  ```
  1100 >> 2
  ----
  0011 (3 in decimal)
  ```

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**:
   - Used to extract specific bits or check if bits are set.
   - Example: `a & 1` checks if the least significant bit of `a` is set.

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**:
   - Used to set specific bits.
   - Example: `a | 1` sets the least significant bit of `a`.

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**:
   - Used to toggle specific bits.
   - Example: `a ^ 1` toggles the least significant bit of `a`.

4. **Bitwise NOT (`^`)**:
   - Used to invert all bits.
   - Example: `^a` flips all bits of `a`.

5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**:
   - Used to multiply by powers of 2.
   - Example: `a << n` is equivalent to `a * (2^n)`.

6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**:
   - Used to divide by powers of 2.
   - Example: `a >> n` is equivalent to `a / (2^n)`.

---

### **Practical Use Cases**
1. **Flags and Bitmasking**:
   - Bitwise operators are often used to manage flags or options packed into a single integer.
   - Example:
     ```go
     const (
         FlagA = 1 << iota // 1
         FlagB             // 2
         FlagC             // 4
     )
     flags := FlagA | FlagC // 1 | 4 = 5
     ```

2. **Efficient Arithmetic**:
   - Left and right shifts are used for efficient multiplication and division by powers of 2.

3. **Cryptography and Hashing**:
   - Bitwise operations are fundamental in cryptographic algorithms and hash functions.

4. **Low-Level Programming**:
   - Bitwise operators are used in device drivers, embedded systems, and performance-critical code.

### **Summary**
Bitwise operators in Go allow you to manipulate the binary representation of integers. They 
are powerful tools for low-level programming, performance optimization, and working with 
flags or bitfields. Understanding these operators is essential for tasks like cryptography, 
hardware interaction, and efficient arithmetic.
