The term **"most significant chunk"** refers to the highest-order (leftmost) chunk in a 
multi-word integer representation. In the context of the `fixedBigInt` struct, the integer 
is divided into multiple 64-bit chunks (words), and the **most significant chunk** is the 
one that contains the highest-order bits of the integer.

Let’s break this down in detail:

---

### **1. Multi-Word Integer Representation**
When dealing with large integers that cannot fit into a single machine word (e.g., a 64-bit 
  `uint64`), the integer is split into multiple words (chunks). For example:
- A 128-bit integer is split into **2 chunks** of 64 bits each.
- A 256-bit integer is split into **4 chunks** of 64 bits each.

Each chunk represents a portion of the integer, with the **most significant chunk** being the 
one that contains the highest-order bits.

---

### **2. Example: 130-Bit Integer**
Let’s take the example of a 130-bit integer:
- Since each chunk is 64 bits, we need **3 chunks** to store 130 bits:
  - Chunk 0: Bits 0–63 (least significant chunk).
  - Chunk 1: Bits 64–127.
  - Chunk 2: Bits 128–129 (most significant chunk).

Here, **Chunk 2** is the **most significant chunk** because it contains the highest-order 
bits (bits 128 and 129).

---

### **3. Why the Most Significant Chunk is Special**
The most significant chunk is special because:
1. **It May Not Be Fully Utilized**:
   - In the case of a 130-bit integer, only 2 bits of the third chunk (Chunk 2) are used. 
     The remaining 62 bits are unused.
   - This is why the `msbMask` is needed: to ensure that only the relevant bits in the most 
     significant chunk are used, and the unused bits are masked out.

2. **It Determines the Overall Size of the Integer**:
   - The most significant chunk defines the upper limit of the integer’s value. For example, 
     in a 130-bit integer, the most significant chunk contributes the highest 2 bits to the 
     overall value.

---

### **4. How `msbMask` Works**
The `msbMask` is a bitmask that ensures only the relevant bits in the most significant 
chunk are used. It is calculated as:
```go
msbMask := (1 << (64 - n%64)) - 1
```

#### **Example: 130-Bit Integer**
- `n = 130` (total bits).
- `n % 64 = 130 % 64 = 2` (number of bits used in the most significant chunk).
- `64 - 2 = 62` (number of unused bits in the most significant chunk).
- `1 << 62` is `0x4000000000000000` (a `1` in the 63rd bit position).
- Subtracting `1` gives `0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` (a mask with `1`s in the first 62 bits).

This mask ensures that only the first 2 bits of the most significant chunk are used, and 
the remaining 62 bits are ignored.

### **5. Visual Representation**
Let’s visualize a 130-bit integer stored in 3 chunks:

| Chunk Index | Bits          | Description                     |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 0           | 0–63          | Least significant chunk         |
| 1           | 64–127        | Middle chunk                    |
| 2           | 128–129       | Most significant chunk          |

- Chunk 2 (most significant chunk) only uses 2 bits (bits 128 and 129).
- The `msbMask` ensures that only these 2 bits are considered when performing operations 
  on the integer.

---

### **6. Why is This Important?**
The most significant chunk is critical because:
1. **Precision**:
   - It ensures that the integer has exactly `n` bits, even if the most significant chunk 
     is not fully utilized.
2. **Efficiency**:
   - By masking out unused bits, operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison can 
     be performed efficiently without unnecessary computations on unused bits.
3. **Correctness**:
   - Without the `msbMask`, unused bits in the most significant chunk could lead to incorrect 
     results or overflow.

---

### **7. Practical Example**
Suppose we have a 130-bit integer with the following binary representation:
```
Chunk 2 (MSB): 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011
Chunk 1:       1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
Chunk 0 (LSB): 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
```
- The most significant chunk (Chunk 2) only uses the last 2 bits (`11`).
- The `msbMask` (`0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`) ensures that only these 2 bits are considered, and 
  the rest are masked out.

---

### **Summary**
- The **most significant chunk** is the highest-order chunk in a multi-word integer.
- It may not be fully utilized, so a bitmask (`msbMask`) is used to ensure only the relevant 
  bits are considered.
- This is crucial for maintaining precision, efficiency, and correctness when working with 
  fixed-size multi-word integers.
