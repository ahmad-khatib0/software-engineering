-- When we say a log is ordered, what we mean is that a record’s position in the log is fixed, and never changes

-- Kafka topics are extremely flexible with what you store in them. For example, you can have homgenous 
   topics that contain only one type of data, or heterogeneous topics that contain multiple types of data.

-- A bootstrap server is the host/IP pair for one or more brokers


There are 3 basic kinds of processors in Kafka Streams:
Source processors - 
    Sources are where information flows into the Kafka Streams application.
    Data is read from a Kafka topic and sent to one or more stream processors.
  
Stream processors - 
    These processors are responsible for applying data processing / transformation logic
    on the input stream. In the high-level DSL, these processors are defined 
    using a set of built-in operators that are exposed by the Kafka Streams 
    library, Some example operators are: filter, map, flatMap, and join.

Sink processors - 
    Sinks are where enriched, transformed, filtered, or otherwise processed records are written 
    back to Kafka, either to be handled by another stream processing application or to be sent 
    to a downstream datastore via something like Kafka Connect. Like source processors, 
    sink processors are connected to a Kafka topic.


-- if your topology reads from one source topic that contains 16 partitions,
    then Kafka Streams will create 16 tasks, each of which will instantiate it’s own copy
    of the underlying processor topology. Once Kafka Streams has created all of the
    tasks, it will assign the source partitions to be read from to each task.
