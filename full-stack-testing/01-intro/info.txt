- Key Takeaways
  Here are the key takeaways from this chapter:

• Software quality cannot be equated to just bug-free functionality anymore. An
  application can be deemed suboptimal in quality if its holistic quality dimensions
  (security, performance, visual quality, etc.) are not on par.
• Full stack testing refers to testing all the quality dimensions of an application
  holistically at every layer, thereby delivering high-quality software.
• For full stack testing to meet its goal of delivering high-quality software, teams
  should shift testing to the left, so that it begins in parallel with analysis and 
  continues throughout the delivery cycle. • Shift-left testing embodies the aphorism 
  “Quality is the team’s responsibility,” as it demands that every role in the team take 
  ownership of performing certain quality checks at different phases of delivery. This 
  requires all team members to upskill themselves, acquiring relevant testing skills at 
  varied competency levels.
• The two classic monolithic categories of testing skills, manual and automated, mask a 
  vast set of new testing skills required to perform full stack testing efficiently.
