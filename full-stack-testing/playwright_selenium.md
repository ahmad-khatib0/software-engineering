The choice between **Playwright** and **Selenium** depends on your project needs. Here's a
detailed comparison to help you decide:

---

### **🔥 Key Differences at a Glance**
| Feature          | **Playwright**                          | **Selenium**                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Speed**        | Faster (built for modern web apps)     | Slower (legacy architecture)         |
| **Browser Support** | Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (Safari)  | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.  |
| **API**          | Simpler, more modern API               | More verbose, older API               |
| **Auto-Waits**   | Built-in smart waits                   | Manual waits required                 |
| **Parallelism**  | Native support (no extra setup)       | Requires Grid or complex setup       |
| **Mobile**       | Limited (emulation only)              | Better (Appium integration)          |
| **Community**    | Growing (Microsoft-backed)            | Mature (larger community)            |

### **🎯 When to Choose Playwright?**
1. **You need speed** – Playwright is **2-3x faster** in execution.
2. **Modern web apps** – Better for SPAs (React, Vue, Angular).
3. **Auto-waiting** – No more flaky `ExpectedConditions` or `Thread.sleep()`.
4. **Easy parallelism** – Built-in context isolation for tests.
5. **Video recording** – Built-in test failure videos.

   ```javascript
   // Example: Playwright's auto-waiting in action (no explicit waits needed)
   await page.click('#submit'); // Automatically waits for element
   ```

---

### **🛠️ When to Choose Selenium?**
1. **Legacy systems** – If you're maintaining old Selenium tests.
2. **Browser diversity** – Need IE11 or older browsers.
3. **Mobile testing** – Already using Appium (Selenium-based).
4. **Large community** – More Stack Overflow answers/plugins.

   ```java
   // Selenium still requires manual waits
   WebElement button = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("submit")));
   button.click();
   ```

### **📊 Benchmark Example**
| Scenario          | Playwright Time | Selenium Time |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 100 test actions | ~45 sec         | ~120 sec       |
| Parallel tests (5) | ~60 sec        | ~300 sec+      |

### **🚀 Migration Considerations**
- **From Selenium to Playwright**: Easy if using JavaScript/TypeScript (harder for Java/Python teams).
- **Existing Selenium Grid**: Playwright has no direct Grid alternative (but doesn’t need one).

---

### **💡 Recommendation**
- **New projects?** → **Playwright** (unless you need IE/old browsers).
- **Existing Selenium suite?** → Stick with Selenium unless you’re willing to migrate.
- **Mobile testing?** → Selenium + Appium.

**Playwright is the future**, but Selenium still dominates in legacy environments.
