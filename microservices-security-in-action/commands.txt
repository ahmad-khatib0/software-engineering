$$ mvn clean install
## If you run into problems while running the command, old and incompatible dependencies might reside in your 
   local Maven repository. To get rid of such problems, try removing (or renaming) the .m2 directory that 
   resides in your home directory (~/.m2/). The preceding command instructs Maven to compile your source code
   and produce a runnable artifact known as a Java Archive (JAR) file. Note that you need to have Java and Maven 
   installed to execute this step successfully. If your build is successful, youâ€™ll see the message BUILD SUCCESS.
